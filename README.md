## Bomberman

### This repository is representing first part of my bachelor's degree.
### To run this project correctly you need to install pygame into your virtual enviroment if you are using one.
### This project is still in development.
### For player movement you can use W,S,A,D keys or arrow keys on your keyboard and spacebar/enter(or return as said in pygame) is used for placing bombs.
### Once you get into first screen you must press spacebar once to get straight into the game
### While in-game you can press Escape button to get into simple menu screen and navigate from there back into first title page or resume your game
